## How to open and compile project in Unity?

Download <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/install-the-unity-hub-and-editor">Unity Hub<a> to manage Unity and it's different versions.

After downloading/cloning repository master branch, launch Unity. Use 2018.3.12f1 64x version if possible, which can be found on the <a href="https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive">Unity Archive Releases<a>. In the user panel, press Open which was marked on the image below.

If you have any issues, make sure your Unity Hub launcher has the correct editor selected and the proper version is installed.

The loading status will start. It can take some time. When it's finished you will see Unity with blank scene. If you want to build the project by yourself choose from ```File``` tab ```Build Settings``` option.
